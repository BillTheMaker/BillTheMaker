- 👋 Hi, I’m @BillTheMaker

I take a systems approach to design, so my designs and design process is typically not optimized if you're looking at it in a tunnel, most details have a purpose and a place though
and I usually remember and explain as I go. 

My first career was in martial arts, massage therapy, Chinese medicine, and meditation. I have unique design considerations as a result of my first career, first and foremost is 
my absolute hatred for every form of human to computer interface I have seen. Fortunately I'm not the only one, ergo enthusiasts get at me, let's make this better.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning about 10 things at any one time, my brain is organized on a rotating spindle so though I know where everything fits but everything isn't accessible
at the same time, only so much mental RAM means only so many programs can be open at any one time.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on typing automation systems or Human-computer-interaction such as KVM, Macro-software, head/vision tracking, or ergonomic mouse/keybrd design.
