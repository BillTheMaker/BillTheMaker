- 👋 Hi, I’m @BillTheMaker

I take a systems approach to design, so my designs and design process is typically not optimized if you're looking at it in a tunnel.

My first career was in martial arts, massage therapy, Chinese medicine, and meditation. I have unique design considerations as a result of my first career, first and foremost is 
my absolute hatred for every form of human to computer interface I have seen. Fortunately I'm not the only one, ergo enthusiasts get at me, let's make this better.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on prototyping better Human-computer-interaction such as KVM, Macro-software, head/vision tracking, and ergonomic mouse/keybrd design.
