- 👋 Hi, I’m @BillTheMaker

I'm an ergonomics nerd who's in over his head trying to learn how to make computers and robots do what I want.

There's lots of problems with computers and robots I intend to exacerbate. The Human interface device (mice, keyboards and the like) industry is static because the barrier to entry is too high. Great buttons lose, great configuration software wins. 

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on prototyping better Human-computer-interaction such as KVM, Macro-software, head/vision tracking, and ergonomic mouse/keybrd design.
