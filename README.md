- 👋 Hi, I’m @BillTheMaker

I'm an erogonomics nerd who's in over his head trying to learn how to make computers and robots do what I want.

There's lots of problems with computers and robots i intend to exacerbate,  first and foremost is my absolute hatred for every form of human to computer interface I have seen. Fortunately I'm not the only one, ergo enthusiasts get at me, let's make this better.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on prototyping better Human-computer-interaction such as KVM, Macro-software, head/vision tracking, and ergonomic mouse/keybrd design.
